# DomeDrum

**DomeDrum** is an open source MIDI controller.

Our aim of making the first version of **DomeDrum** was building a drum controller which feels like an analog drum. Did you ever play a [Djembe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djembe)? It has one surface Depending on where you hit it the sound differs. We like pad-based controller like the [MPC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_Production_Center), too but it's far away from an anlog drum. We wanted to brings that analog feeling back.

# DIY

To asseble your own DomeDrum you need to mill the wooden body, assemble the electronics and upload our Arduino software to the [Teensie Board](http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/).
We used an additional »head« made out of silicone on top of the wooden body for a softer feel while drumming. Use whatever you think feels good here.
